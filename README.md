# Base32Implementation-DataSecurity
This is a project given by University of Pristina professor, and we combined source code and our experience to get this done.

## Usage
This is a project in which one we will implement base32 method of encoding characters, texts etc.
If u are going to try this one in Java then u have to create a package with exactly same name as we used and then everything is fine.
In Python there are not any requirements except that u need to have python configured in your device and some of the libraries needed for the file to run.

## Language
We have used programming language Java and Python in which we are more experienced but doesnt mean that there are not any other languages to implement.
In python we have implemented an type of base32 called crockford and in Java is the native one.
We got testing files in both languages, in Java from our implementation file and in Python from it's own base32 configuration.
This code is open source which people implemented before but we just managed to make changes and make that one work for our needs, so if anyone has problem with it
feel free to contact us.
